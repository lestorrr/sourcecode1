        The checkbox will be used to trigger the click event.
        Checking it and un-checking it will allow you to change the icon into and X and back to normal.
        We apply an id because we will use the id to pair the checkbox to the label. This is crucial to
        make the click event work.
    -->
    <input type="checkbox" id="menu-toggle">
    <!-- 
        We wrap all the markup that is relevant to the hamburger menu inside a label. Again, this is crucial
        to make this click even work without JavaScript. We pair the label to the checkbox by passing in the
        checkbox's id (menu-toggle) inside the label's for="" attribute. 
    -->
    <label for="menu-toggle" class="hamburger">
        <!--
            To make this effect work, animation wise, we have to nest buns inside buns since apple uses 2 different
            transition effects for their hamburger menu animation. We apply a bun class for general bun styles, then
            a secondary class of top and bottom to modify these elements individually. The outer bun will have the
            rotation transition.

            The inner buns (bun-crust) will determine the overall width and height of the bars as well as the spacing
            between them. The same concept applies as before with the additional top and bottom classes. The inner buns
            will have the transition effect for animating the up and down movement before and after turning into an X.
